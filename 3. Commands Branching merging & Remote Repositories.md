## 3. Basic Git Commands

### Initializing a Repository
1. **Create a New Git Repository:**
   - Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
   - Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - This creates a hidden `.git` directory that tracks your version history.

### Cloning a Repository
1. **Clone an Existing Repository:**
   - To create a local copy of a remote repository, use:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

### Checking Status
1. **Check the Status of Your Files:**
   - To see which files have changes that need to be committed, run:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

### Staging Changes
1. **Stage Individual Files:**
   - To stage changes to a specific file, use:
     ```bash
     git add <file>
     ```
   - Replace `<file>` with the name of the file you want to stage.

2. **Stage All Changes:**
   - To stage all changes in your working directory, use:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

### Committing Changes
1. **Commit Staged Changes:**
   - To commit your staged changes with a message, run:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     ```

### Viewing Commit History
1. **View the Commit History:**
   - To see the history of commits in your repository, use:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

## 4. Branching and Merging

### Branch Management
1. **List Branches:**
   - To list all branches in your repository, run:
     ```bash
     git branch
     ```

2. **Create a New Branch:**
   - To create a new branch, use:
     ```bash
     git branch <branch-name>
     ```
   - Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the new branch.

3. **Switch to a Different Branch:**
   - To switch to a different branch, use:
     ```bash
     git checkout <branch-name>
     ```

### Merging Branches
1. **Merge Changes from One Branch into Another:**
   - First, switch to the branch you want to merge into:
     ```bash
     git checkout <target-branch>
     ```
   - Then, merge the changes from the other branch:
     ```bash
     git merge <source-branch>
     ```
   - Replace `<target-branch>` with the branch you are merging into and `<source-branch>` with the branch you are merging from.

### Deleting Branches
1. **Delete a Branch:**
   - To delete a branch that you no longer need, use:
     ```bash
     git branch -d <branch-name>
     ```

## 5. Remote Repositories

### Managing Remotes
1. **Add a New Remote Repository:**
   - To add a new remote repository, use:
     ```bash
     git remote add <name> <url>
     ```
   - Replace `<name>` with a name for the remote (e.g., `origin`) and `<url>` with the URL of the remote repository.

2. **List Remote Repositories:**
   - To list all configured remote repositories, use:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```

### Fetching and Pulling
1. **Fetch Updates from a Remote Repository:**
   - To fetch updates from a remote repository without merging, use:
     ```bash
     git fetch
     ```

2. **Fetch and Merge Updates from a Remote Repository:**
   - To fetch updates from a remote repository and merge them into your local branch, use:
     ```bash
     git pull
     ```

### Pushing Changes
1. **Push Local Changes to a Remote Repository:**
   - To push your local commits to a remote repository, use:
     ```bash
     git push <remote> <branch>
     ```
   - Replace `<remote>` with the name of the remote (e.g., `origin`) and `<branch>` with the name of the branch you want to push.
